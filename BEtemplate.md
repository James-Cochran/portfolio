## Description
This PR adds the ability to delete a company for a user through the DELETE /api/v1/users/:userid/companies/:id endpoint.

When a company is deleted, any associated job applications are also removed, while contacts remain intact.

I commented out strict: true in the CompaniesController Rolify call. Wally  and I believe this was mistakenly included. After reviewing the Rolify documentation, we found no reason for its presence in this controller. All tests still pass with it commented out.

Documentation in the README was updated for this endpoint.

Tests were written for successful and unsuccessful requests (unauthorized access, non-existent company).

## Motivation and Context
This change was required to allow users to remove companies they no longer need while maintaining data integrity by keeping contacts but removing job applications.
