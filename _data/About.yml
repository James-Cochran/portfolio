      I am a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building scalable, impactful solutions. My journey into tech began after years of leading nonprofit teams, where I honed problem-solving skills and a strategic mindset. As an operations leader, I optimized workflows, managed high-performing teams, and helped Goodwill Eastern North Carolina achieve a 12% revenue increase.

      Driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving, I transitioned into software development to build solutions that create meaningful change. At Turing School, I immersed myself in backend and frontend technologies, mastering Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, API development, and Test-Driven Development. I thrive on tackling complex challenges, writing clean, efficient code, and developing solutions that balance functionality and user experience.

      Iâ€™m eager to join a team that values collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning. Whether improving backend architecture or crafting intuitive frontends, I am excited to contribute to software that makes a real difference.
